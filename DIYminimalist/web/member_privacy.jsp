           <label style="font-size:30px">Privacy Policy</label>
           <p>DIY minimalist takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously.</p>

           <p>This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided by Automattic (WordPress.com), describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice very carefully. </p>

           <label>Website Visitors</label>
           <p>Like most website operators, DIY minimalist collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DIY minimalist?s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how DIY minimalist?s visitors use its website. From time to time, DIY minimalist may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

           <p>DIY minimalist also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DIY minimalist does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

           <label>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</label>
           <p>Certain visitors to DIY minimalist?s websites choose to interact with DIY minimalist in ways that require DIY minimalist to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that DIY minimalist gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for DIY minimalist to provide a username and email address. In each case, DIY minimalist collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor?s interaction with DIY minimalist. DIY minimalist does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

           <label>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</label>
           <p>DIY minimalist discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on DIY minimalist?s behalf or to provide services available at DIY minimalist?s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using DIY minimalist?s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if DIY minimalist or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that DIY minimalist goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of DIY minimalist may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, DIY minimalist will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>

           <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, DIY minimalist discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when DIY minimalist believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of DIY minimalist, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a DIY minimalist website and have supplied your email address, DIY minimalist may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what?s going on with DIY minimalist and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. DIY minimalist takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

           <label>Cookies</label>
           <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor?s computer, and that the visitor?s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. DIY minimalist uses cookies to help DIY minimalist identify and track visitors, their usage of DIY minimalist websites, and their website access preferences. DIY minimalist visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using DIY minimalist?s websites, with the drawback that certain features of DIY minimalist?s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

           <label>Security</label>
           <p>All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying-information described above is stored on restricted database servers.</p>

           <label>Privacy Policy Changes</label>
           <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, DIY minimalist may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in DIY minimalist?s sole discretion. DIY minimalist encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

           <label>Contact Us</label>
           <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our sites in general, please DO NOT contact us. Don't. Ever. We'll call the cops on you. </p>
